# Document-scanner-app-with-Optical-Character-Recognition.
This repository contains a  document scanner app that could perform Optical Character Recognition.

Here the approach is taken to build an app that can scan a document, crop the document and then perform optical character recognition. 

The app is developed using Android Studio.

Finally the accuracy of the app is tested using practical scenarios and confusion matrix is created to evaluated the output.
